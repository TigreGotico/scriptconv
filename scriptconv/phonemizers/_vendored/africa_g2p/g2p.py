                    ``kp``, ``ɔ`` — a phonemic segmentation in native orthography, which
                    trains TTS/ASR models better than IPA. For non-Latin scripts this
                    yields the Latin romanisation when one is available (falling back to
                    the native script otherwise). Or
                    "ipa": International Phonetic Alphabet transcription; or
                    "latin": romanise a non-Latin script to its Latin form (uses the
                    language's script→Latin map; Latin input passes through unchanged).
            unknown: how to treat a grapheme with no mapping —
                     "passthrough" (keep the character), "drop", or "mark" (�).

                   phoneme symbols and IPA diacritics (strips any leaked orthographic
                   tone/accent marks).

                   tone/accent marks (acute, grave, circumflex, …) from the native
                   output while keeping segmental letters (ɔ, ɛ, ŋ, dot-below) and
                   nasalization. Default False (preserve the written form exactly).

                   silently is worse than an error because the output still looks
