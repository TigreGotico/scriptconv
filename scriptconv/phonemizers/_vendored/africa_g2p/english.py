"""English grapheme-to-phoneme, backed by espeak-ng.

English orthography is deep — the same letters take different values depending on
etymology and morphology, so `ough` alone has six pronunciations. The longest-match
grapheme tables that work for the shallow orthographies in this package cannot represent
that: they map ``through``, ``though``, ``tough`` and ``thought`` to one identical string.

espeak-ng carries a pronunciation lexicon plus letter-to-sound rules for anything outside
it, which matters for African names and borrowings that appear throughout African English
speech — ``Akosua``, ``Kwabena``, ``obroni`` are all handled, where a dictionary-only
approach returns nothing.

Output is normalised to the same IPA conventions as the rest of the package, so English
phonemes share one space with the 400 rule-based languages. Every symbol espeak emits
already occurs somewhere in those languages, so English introduces no foreign symbols and
no per-language tagging is needed: where a symbol is shared the sound genuinely is shared,
and where English differs IPA already distinguishes it (``æ`` is not ``a``, ``ɹ`` is not
``r``).

Requires the optional dependency::

    pip install phonemizer          # and the espeak-ng binary
