"""Cross-language grapheme converter.

Takes the native-orthography graphemes of one language and rewrites them in the
graphemes another language uses for the same phonemes, routing both through IPA:

    L1 graphemes -> IPA -> L2 graphemes

Either side may be the virtual language ``"universal"`` — the per-IPA grapheme set distilling
    all 400 language charts: majority winners of ``scripts/ipa_universal_graphemes.py``, re-judged
    per IPA by Gemini into common Latin/English spellings (see
    ``scripts/build_universal_from_gemini.py``). When a source phoneme has no entry in the target's
    chart, the universal grapheme is used as a fallback.
