"""orthography2ipa-backed phonemizer.

Wraps ``orthography2ipa.G2P`` to expose the shared grapheme->IPA lattice as a
``BasePhonemizer``.  A single instance covers the whole orthography2ipa family
(hundreds of language specs: the Arabic lects, Basque, Galician, Mirandese,
Portuguese, the East-Slavic set, ...): one backend, many languages, always IPA.

Per-language quality varies -- the lattice is strongest for regular
orthographies.  For undiacritized Arabic use ``ArbtokPhonemizer`` (which adds a
diacritizer on top of this same lattice); for dialect-aware Basque use
``EuskaphonePhonemizer``.

``orthography2ipa`` is imported lazily so importing ``scriptconv`` never requires
it; install with ``pip install orthography2ipa`` (or ``pip install scriptconv[o2i]``).
